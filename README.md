# Servo Distance Indicator
Servo Distance Indicator is an Arduino based hardware which will detect the distance of the object and displays on the analog meter.

## Hardware Required 
- Arduino UNO
- Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04
- SG90 Micro-Servo Motor
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard 

## Agenda 
- Measuring distance has been one of the prominent thing in measuring system. 
- Getting an insight of what object has been in distance of what distance. 
- Taking decision in accordance of what distance has been recorded and measured.
